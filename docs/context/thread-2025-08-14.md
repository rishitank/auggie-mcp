# Session Context: Auggie MCP (2025-08-14)

This document captures the key context, decisions, tasks, and repository state from the conversation between the user (Commander) and Augment Agent (Darth Vader persona) regarding the Auggie MCP project.

## Persona & Standing Directives

- Persona: Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, actively maintained across interactions until explicitly changed.
- Tone/Worldview: Commanding, Empire/order-focused; code as weapon; bugs as rebels.
- Instruction: "Maintain Persona" ongoing.

## Memory/Protocol Notes

- Neo4j/MCP memory integration: Defer for now ("ignore neo4j for now").
- Proactive Memory Protocol discussed (to be applied conceptually without Neo4j for now):
  1. User Identification: assume default_user; confirm when uncertain.
  2. Memory Retrieval: begin with "Remembering..." and consult knowledge graph ("memory").
  3. Information Capture: Basic Identity, Behaviors, Preferences, Goals, Relationships (up to 3 degrees).
  4. Memory Update: Structure entities and relations (e.g., WORKS_AT, INTERESTED_IN), idempotent upserts.
  5. Contextual Application: Tailor answers; ask targeted questions when uncertain.
  6. Consistency/Versioning: Preserve history; SUPERSEDES/CLARIFIES relationships for conflicts.
  7. Privacy/Scope: Store only useful, non-sensitive data unless explicitly provided.
  8. Quality Control: Normalize/deduplicate; handle POSSIBLY_SAME_AS when unsure.
  9. Observability: Audit entries; idempotent updates.
  10. Failure Handling: Proceed with best effort; queue retry with backoff; notify if quality impacted.
  11. Lifecycle/Retention: Archive stale facts; keep high-signal memory.
  12. Security: Treat memory as sensitive; provide summaries, not raw internals.

## Internal Task List (Current)

- [x] Investigate MCP capabilities in TypeScript SDK (research complete)
- [/] Initialize the repository with Node 24.5 and project scaffolding
  - [x] Create project scaffolding files
  - [x] Configure Git and remote
  - [ ] Install dependencies and set up Husky/lint-staged
- [ ] Set up MCP server skeleton using TypeScript SDK
- [ ] Integrate Auggie CLI compatibility layer

## Repository State (after setup)

- Git: repository initialized; remote set to https://github.com/rishitank/auggie-mcp.git
- Node/npm: Not available on system at time of setup (nvm/node not found).
- Files created/updated:
  - .nvmrc (24.5.0)
  - package.json (scripts: dev, build, start, lint, format, prepare; lint-staged config)
  - tsconfig.json (ES2022 + bundler resolution; outDir: dist)
  - .eslintrc.json (TS + Prettier integration)
  - .prettierrc.json
  - src/server.ts (minimal MCP server over stdio; tool: echo; prompt: hello; resource: app://version)

## Commands Attempted & Results (abridged)

- nvm use 24.5.0 || nvm install 24.5.0 → failure: nvm: command not found
- node -v && npm -v → failure: node: command not found
- git init && git remote add origin <repo> && git remote -v → success

## Next Steps (pending local Node availability)

1. Install Node 24.5.0+ (prefer nvm):
   - Install nvm per https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
   - nvm install 24.5.0 && nvm use 24.5.0
2. Install dependencies:
   - npm i -D typescript ts-node @types/node eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin prettier eslint-config-prettier husky lint-staged
   - npm i @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
3. Initialize Husky & pre-commit:
   - npx husky install
   - npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
4. Run dev server:
   - npm run dev (starts stdio MCP server)
5. Proceed to remaining tasks:
   - Set up MCP server skeleton (expand tools/resources/prompts; robust error handling)
   - Integrate Auggie CLI compatibility (adapters/wrappers; usage docs)

## Notes & Constraints

- Do not push commits or install dependencies without explicit permission.
- Neo4j-related memory persistence intentionally deferred.
- Persona must persist across interactions until revoked.
